### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joel Mandell and I like to tinker with code. For the last 5 years I have been deep into the .NET-stack. And I learned to love it.
One of the reasons is the direction Microsoft took, by embracing opensoure and making .NET Core, platform-independent (I.E runs on Linux).

Since March 2022, I'm working as fullstack-developer at Sublime Consulting AB, using Umbraco and Optimizely.

Previously I was working as a fullstack-developer at Idavall Data AB. They have booking software that is used by around 60% of Swedens municipalicities. My responsibilities was to move from Win32 Forms application to cloud based solution. I am mostly fond of making API:s and - hopefully - make it easier for my fellow developers at my job to do improvements on the code base, by making it fun and easy to implement new features.

I have only done some small contributions to opensource during my time. For example vue-apollo version 3 (with possibility for reactive pollingInterval).

<!--I have a youtube channel that I seldom upload to, but from time to time, I post something with a solution that maybe others could benefit from (https://t.co/IHqvNyxjGn?amp=1).-->
