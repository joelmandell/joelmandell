### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=joelmandell)

My name is Joel Mandell and I like to tinker with code. For the last 9 years I have been deep into the .NET-stack. And I learned to love it.
One of the reasons is the direction Microsoft took: by embracing opensoure and making .NET Core, platform-independent (I.E runs on Linux).

I would love to create software that other developers can use (i.e. framework, libraries, IDEs). I do not have any project on my own, but sometimes i try to contribute to OSS projects. Examples of some projects I have done PRs for: [efcore](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), [bUnit](https://github.com/bUnit-dev/bUnit), [vue-apollo](https://github.com/vuejs/apollo).

I was working as fullstack developer at a company called Idavall Data AB between October 2016-March 2022.

And between March 2022 and November 2023, I was working as fullstack-developer at Sublime Consulting AB, using Umbraco 9,10,11 and Optimizely.
A lot of focus was on Server-rendered Blazor components  Blazor is something I fell in love immediately since its announcement.

Now I am working as Senior Software Architect at Idavall Data AB (back to the "roots"). They have software for managing rental and bookings of arenas, gyms and so on. It is used by around 60% of Swedens municipalicities. My previous responsibilities was to move from Win32 Forms application to cloud based solution. Now my focus is to deliver a new product "Interbook FRI".

My goal is to always make it easier for my fellow developers to do improvements on the code base, by making it fun to maintain, while easy to implement new features.

<!--I have a youtube channel that I seldom upload to, but from time to time, I post something with a solution that maybe others could benefit from (https://t.co/IHqvNyxjGn?amp=1).-->
