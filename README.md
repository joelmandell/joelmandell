### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=joelmandell)

My name is Joel Mandell and I like to tinker with code. For the last 7 years I have been deep into the .NET-stack. And I learned to love it.
One of the reasons is the direction Microsoft took: by embracing opensoure and making .NET Core, platform-independent (I.E runs on Linux).

I would love to create software that other developers can use (i.e. framework, libraries, IDEs). I do not have any project on my own, but sometimes i try to contribute to OSS projects. Examples of some projects I have done PRs for: [efcore](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), [bUnit](https://github.com/bUnit-dev/bUnit), [vue-apollo](https://github.com/vuejs/apollo).


Since March 2022, I'm working as fullstack-developer at Sublime Consulting AB, using Umbraco 9,10,11 and Optimizely.
A lot of focus has been on Server-rendered Blazor components lately. Blazor is something I fell in love immediately since its announcement.

Previously I was working as a fullstack-developer at Idavall Data AB. They have booking software that is used by around 60% of Swedens municipalicities. My responsibilities was to move from Win32 Forms application to cloud based solution. 

My goal is to always make it easier for my fellow developers to do improvements on the code base, by making it fun to maintain, while easy to implement new features.

<!--I have a youtube channel that I seldom upload to, but from time to time, I post something with a solution that maybe others could benefit from (https://t.co/IHqvNyxjGn?amp=1).-->
